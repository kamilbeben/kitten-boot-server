# kitten-boot-server

Simple spring-boot-started based framework (i.e. few components, services and configurations wrapped together).

# Usage
The project is not finished yet and it doesn't have any decent documentation and i don't recommend using it yet.
BUT, if you must know, go and see an example [here](https://github.com/kamilbeben/kitten-boot-example).
